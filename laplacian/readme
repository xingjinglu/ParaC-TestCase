1.---- final_jia---
The version optimized by FanMR.

2. --- parac --- 
High level version with ParaC.
1) ParaC autogenerated version: laplacian.c, laplacian.cl 
2) Time Profiling: laplacian_time.c laplacian.cl // Add time prof on 1).
3) Opt manual by lxj: laplacian_time_opt.c laplacian_opt_lxj.cl
4) opt by lxj and paramerterized for input, like 256, 1024.
2.1 The correction version ParaC code.
2.1.1 laplacian_opt_lxj_2048.c (.cl)
kernel_1: vector parallelizing, *4;
kernel_2: vector parallelizing on gidx direction, *4;
kernel_3: Extract load/store outof if block; result stored in register;

2.1.2  LDS opt on kernel_2
laplacian_opt_lds_1024.cl/c
kernel_2: lds opt.


2.1.3 Vector parallel on Vertical direction 
kernel_2: vect parallelizing on the Vertical direction.
The Jia Haipeng version.

2.1.4 remove bank confilicts for LDS opt of kernel_2
laplaian_opt_lds_optbank_1024.c

Result: not work, because when remove store conflicts, there are still read conflicts, 
  and the performance get worse.
