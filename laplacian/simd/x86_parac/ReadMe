1th iterator: horizon filter, 3 parts: pre, body, lat;
2nd iterator: Vertical filter.
3rd iterator: serial execution.

--- laplacian8 ---
1) kernel-1: unroll(8), read-redunt(len8*5) 

--- laplacian10 ---
1) kernel-1: Same as the laplaican8.

3. laplacian9:
1) Multi ---> shift, no performance gains.

1. laplacian11:
1) 1st iterator:  redundant memory load; unroll(8); un-aligned load
2)
